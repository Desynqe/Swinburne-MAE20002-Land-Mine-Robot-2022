Initialise the 10 parameters for sensing colours with the phototransistors. The colours being red, blue, white, and black.

Initialise a row matrix of 17 elements for +- 80 degrees from a 0 degree bearing, at 10 degree intervals.

Initialise a row matrix of 17 elements, each element being a pre-determined duration in seconds that the robot will drive forward and backwards.

Initialise more variables as constants, being different times in seconds, for different operations later in the program.

Initialise myDAQ and create a session.

Create input channels for both phototransistor analog voltages and 3 bumper switch digital signals.

Create output channels for both DC motor digital signals, the analog servo motor voltage, and an LED for signalling a caught puck.

Begin the path:
1. From the starting location (facing forward into the field), drive backward into the wall. 
2. Drive forward to the black line.
3. Turn 80 degrees to the left.
4. Drive forward looking for a puck.
5. If no red puck is found in the time limit corresponding to the bearing, reverse to the black line and jump to step [15]
6. If a red puck is found, or the time limit is reached, stop the robot.
7. Close the claw
8. Reverse to behind the black line.
9. Turn 180 degrees
10. Drive forward a little bit.
11. Drop the puck
12. Reverse a little bit.
13. Turn 180 degrees.
14. If n = 17 (see step 15) jump to step 16. If not, continue to step 15.
15. Return to step 4 with a new bearing, where the New Bearing = 80-10n, where 'n' is the number of times step 14 has been reached. 
16. End the program.
